- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
- This file contains 1 or 2 practises for each parts I learned recently and one little project(jigsaw game) 
- Still have to practise the parts below for the basic coding,
  which will be completed in 2 weeks.

-future plan：
After the basic parts, I plan to learn JavaWeb like Vue or Springboot, and then the Spring Cloud.
The plan may change due to new job's needs or my personal interests.
