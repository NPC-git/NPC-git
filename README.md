- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NPC-git
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JAVA this week,which is widely used in Japan
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
- This file contains 1 or 2 practises for each parts I learned and one little project(the jigsaw) 
- Still have to practise the parts below for the basic coding,
  which will be completed in 2 weeks.

-What's nextï¼š
After the basic parts, I plan to learn JavaWeb like Vue or Springboot, and then the Spring Cloud.
The plan may change due to new job's needs or my personal interests.
