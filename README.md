- This file contains

-1 or 2 practises for each parts I learned recently

-2 little projects（jigsaw game and ）
- Still have to practise the parts mm/mm for basic coding,
  which will be completed in 2 weeks.

- Future Plan：
After the basic parts, I plan to learn JavaWeb like Vue or Springboot, and then the Spring Cloud.
The plan may change due to job's needs or my personal interests.
